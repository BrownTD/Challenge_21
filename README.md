# Challenge_21

For this challenge assignment I are working with an aerospace agency to be part of the first human colony on mars. I have been chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. It is decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency. We will be creating a fungible token (KaseiCoin)that will be ERC-20 compliant, and launch a crowdsale that will allow for those who will be traveling to the colony to convert their money to the new currency.

The crowdsale contract that I will create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAS, or KaseiCoin tokens. I contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

The steps to complete this assignment are as follows; first I need to create the token contract, then the crowdsale contract, then the deployer contract, then deploy the crowdsale to the local blockchain. After deploying the crowdsale to the blockchain I will then make a transaction to test the crowdsale and see if our accounts were able to successfully purchase tokens and if our contract has raised the correct amount of wei.
